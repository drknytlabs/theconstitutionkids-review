## 🛠️ For the Blue Collar GPT Devs

Sometimes, you’re not just coding.  
You’re working third shift with one eye on the waveform and the other on the server logs.

If you’ve ever said:

> “I just patched a real-time waveform visualizer into a browser-based, AI-enhanced review system from scratch while managing dynamic environmental cross-origin repo credentials, conditional express middleware, a shot-calling route loader, and file previews that don't quit...”

Then this stack was built with you in mind.

You’re not alone. You’re building in the dark — with light.
